(##) About this template

* If you choose to implement a task, please **CLEARLY** indicate that you implemented it. You can do this by adding `<font size="10"> IMPLEMENTED </font>` or something similar to the task.

* You can view your writeup by opening it in a browser - right click this file and open with your browser of choice.

* Replace reference images with your own screenshots or renders when applicable.

* If you didn't handle any edge cases or you don't think are any, please state that there isn't any.

* Include descriptions of any encountered problems and the time you spent on each task.

(##) A2L1 CHECKPOINT 

You do not need any screenshots for this task. 

**What edge cases did you handle?**

*  Answer here:

When any endpoint of the edge only has 2 edges or degree<=2, I do not perform splitting since
this will create a vertex with a single edge which makes the shape non-manifold.

Your completion will be graded based on the reference `test.a2.l1.cpp` file and 
checking that the operation works in the GUI.

(##) A2L2 CHECKPOINT 

You do not need any screenshots for this task. 

**What edge cases did you handle?**

*  Answer here:
There is no edge case.

Your completion will be graded based on the reference `test.a2.l2.cpp` file and 
checking that the operation works in the GUI.

(##) A2L3 CHECKPOINT 

You do not need any screenshots for this task. 

**What edge cases did you handle?**

*  Answer here:

- Collapsing some edge will result in non-manifold shape (e.g. hourglass shape). I cheked for 
these cases and abort operation. The illegal cases are:
    - The edge to collapse is not on boundary, AND 2 vertices are on bounary face AND
        - 2 vertices they have no common neighbors, e.g. 2 rectangle case, OR
        - The edges between the common neighbors of 2 vertices, v1->n and v2->n, are not on boundary 
- If the edge to collapse is the edge of one or more triangle, then the faces adjacent to it become degenerating faces.
There are 4 cases:
    - If the upper face of edge e is a triangle, then collapse upper face.
    - If the lower face of edge e is a triangle, then collapse lower face.
    - If both adjacent faces of edge e are triangles, then collapse both faces.
    - If both adjacent faces of edge e are triangles and they are on boundary, i.e.
    at least 3 edges of the quad shape made of 2 triangles are on boundary, then collapse both faces
    and delete the vertex that is owned by only the triangles but not other faces.

Your completion will be graded based on the reference `test.a2.l3.cpp` file and 
checking that the operation works in the GUI.

(##) A2L4 CHECKPOINT 

You do not need any screenshots for this task. 

**What edge cases did you handle?**

*  Answer here:
There is no edge case.

I update the normal of half edges in extrude_position. In the case the area of the face is 0, 
keep the normal as before to avoid NAN values. 

Your completion will be graded based on the reference `test.a2.l4.cpp` file and 
checking that the operation works in the GUI.

(##) A2G1 FINAL 

You do not need any screenshots for this task.

checking that the operation works in the GUI.

(##) A2GO1 CHOICE FINAL 

**Global Operation Completed: ** Yes

You do not need any screenshots for this task. 

Your completion will be graded based on the reference file for the operation of choice and 
checking that the operation works in the GUI.

(##) CREATED MODEL FINAL

Image of model in the GUI:
<div class="twentytwenty-container">
    <img src="A2-writeup/student/mycat.png" alt="My cat loaf">
</div>

Explanation of what it is and how you made it:

This is a cat wearing a collar with a bell. I made the collar and bell using existing shape 
toros and cone. I made the cat from a cube using operations such as extrude face, split edge, catmull-clark.
The scene is stored under A2-writeup/student/ folder.

Any free model sources you need to credit?
No.

(##) A2LX1 EXTRA CREDIT <font size="10"> IMPLEMENTED </font>

You do not need any screenshots for this task. 

**What edge cases did you handle?**

*  Answer here:
- If a vertex is on boundary and it only has a degree of 2, then do not collapse the vertex.
- If a vertex is on boundary and it has a degree larger than 2, then collapse vertex without merging the boundary face.


Your completion will be graded based on the reference `test.a2.lx1.cpp` file and 
checking that the operation works in the GUI.

(##) A2LX2 EXTRA CREDIT <font size="10"> IMPLEMENTED </font>

You do not need any screenshots for this task. 

**What edge cases did you handle?**

*  Answer here:
- When there is only 1 face (+ 1 boundary face), do not perform operation since this will result in 1 boundary face.

checking that the operation works in the GUI.

**What edge cases did you handle?**

*  Answer here:

- If face is a boudary face, do not collapse it.
- If face has >= 2 non-consequtive boundary edges, collapsing this face will result in hour glass shape, do not collapse it.

(##) A2GO2 CHOICE EXTRA CREDIT 

**Global Operation Completed: <font size="10"> IMPLEMENTED </font>**

The instruction does not specify whether we should collapse newly splitted edges. But I feel it
makes more sense if we do not collapse them. So I only collapse old edges not processed by split edge.
Also, I noticed that if we collapse newly splitted edges, the operation may collapse all edges of a mesh. 
This happens when I applied remeshing on a cube after triangulation. 
In this case all newly splitted edges are shorter than mean edge lengths multiplied by the factor.
