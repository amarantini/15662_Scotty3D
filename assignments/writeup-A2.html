(##) About this template

* If you choose to implement a task, please **CLEARLY** indicate that you implemented it. You can do this by adding `<font size="10"> IMPLEMENTED </font>` or something similar to the task.

* You can view your writeup by opening it in a browser - right click this file and open with your browser of choice.

* Replace reference images with your own screenshots or renders when applicable.

* If you didn't handle any edge cases or you don't think are any, please state that there isn't any.

* Include descriptions of any encountered problems and the time you spent on each task.

(##) A2L1 CHECKPOINT

You do not need any screenshots for this task. 

**What edge cases did you handle?**

*  Answer here:

<!-- If the 2 faces adjacent to the edge form a convex polygon, and the interior angles at 2 vertices 
of the edge in the 2-face polygon is larger than 180 degree, the flipped edge will form a
new face (this include the case where the flipped edge overlap with an existing edge, then add
2 more edges to create the new face). -->

Your completion will be graded based on the reference `test.a2.l1.cpp` file and 
checking that the operation works in the GUI.

(##) A2L2 CHECKPOINT

You do not need any screenshots for this task. 

**What edge cases did you handle?**

*  Answer here:

For edge on boundary, split edge only create 1 more face.

Your completion will be graded based on the reference `test.a2.l2.cpp` file and 
checking that the operation works in the GUI.

(##) A2L3 CHECKPOINT

You do not need any screenshots for this task. 

**What edge cases did you handle?**

*  Answer here:

- Collapsing some edge after collapsing will result in non-manifold shape. I cheked for these cases
and abort operation if the operation is illegal. The illegal cases are:
    - The edge to collapse is not on boundary, AND 2 vertices are on bounary face AND
        - 2 vertices they have no common neighbors, e.g. 2 rectangle case, OR
        - The edges between the common neighbors of 2 vertices, v1->n and v2->n, are not on boundary
- If the edge to collapse is the edge of one or more triangle, then the faces adjacent to it become degenerating faces.
There are 4 cases:
    - If the upper face of edge e is a triangle, then collapse upper face.
    - If the lower face of edge e is a triangle, then collapse lower face.
    - If both adjacent faces of edge e are triangles, then collapse both faces.
    - If both adjacent faces of edge e are triangles and they are on boundary, i.e.
    at least 3 edges of the quad shape made of 2 triangles are on boundary, then collapse both faces
    and delete the vertex that is owned by only the triangles but not other faces.

Your completion will be graded based on the reference `test.a2.l3.cpp` file and 
checking that the operation works in the GUI.
