(##) EXTRA CREDIT FINAL

Use this section to explain any extra credit implementations you have made.

I implemented Russian Roulette using overall path throughput as the heuristic.
In trace() function in pathtracer.cpp, I terminate ray tracing in a few bounces if a randomly
generated float is larger than the Russian Roulette probability which is the maximum of the ray's accumulated path throughput.
To enable Russian Roulette, set `RUSSIAN_ROULETTE=true` on the top of pathtracer.cpp.

(##) Feedback

Use this section to provide feedback about the assignment.

I noticed that there is a bug with Glass material. Whenever I tried to change the color of 1 material, 2 color pannels pop up and then the program crashes with the error:
"Assertion failed: (g.ActiveId == id || g.ActiveId == 0 || g.DragDropActive), function MarkItemEdited, file imgui.cpp, line 3417."
