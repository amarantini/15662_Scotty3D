Your completion will be graded based on the reference `test.a4.task4.*.cpp` files and 
checking that particle simulation behaves correctly and does not go through any surface.

(##) ANIMATED VIDEO FINAL

Your animation:
<div class="twentytwenty-container">
    <!-- <img src="A4-writeup/student/animation.mov" alt="Ballet dancer"> -->
    <video src="A4-writeup/student/animation.mp4" controls>
</div>
Explanation of what it is and how you made it:

This is an animation of a human ballet dancer making a turn. The turn consists of 
multiple actions: 
- round arms in front of body
- extend arms in a line
- raise arms to over head
- lift a foot
- rotate the body and make a turn of 360 degree

I made a ballet skirt for the dancer using a cone shape mesh and modify it using modelling tool.
I also added a golden crown for the ballet dancer as he was playing the role of a princess.
I added particle effects to simulate snow fall, though 30s is too short to fully demo snow fall.
The scene animation.js3d is saved under A4-writeup/student folder.
